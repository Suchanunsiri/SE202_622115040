            <p><font face="Century Gothic">For my own information, it's no much. Just a chubby girl like eating, sleeping, playing, and coding.
                I have a little problem with crowd and loud place. Don't know why, but I can't stay there.
                Around 2-3 years ago, I had an allergy. Cat is what I love, even I couldn't play with them.
                I still don't have any idea, but I already cured from that allergy.</font>
